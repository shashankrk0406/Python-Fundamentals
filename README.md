# Python-Fundamentals
Microsoft Certification for Python Fundamentals
This was course 1 of 6 - https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-python-developer#courses
The good: Each topic is iterated 2-3 times so the pace is not to fast and learning does not feel too overwhelming
The Bad: Felt a bit too basic at first with very gradual but real gains. The course end was slow again.
